 Welcome to my Github Page!
 My website is finally up and running.

## What is this blog for? 
-----

This blog is mainly to record my journey as a Computer Science student.

My topics will revolve around academics, coding, and any events that will further my knowledge and help me towards my future career.

I will document experiences at clubs, hackathons, and internships. I will talk about my projects, and the things I build. I will write about my obstacles and mistakes, and what I did to overcome them and learn. Also, give out some tips to other students in a similar situation as me.

Basically, discussing my college life as a CS student.

This blog will help me keep track of what I do, and motivate me to push towards my goal of graduating and having a professional career.
